# I have done pizza store analysis - This is a real project on real dataset   

✅ Situation
•	 The business wanted to evaluate the performance of their pizza store operations.
•	 Focus areas included understanding which categories and toppings were most popular.
•	 They also wanted insights into sales patterns during different times of the day.
•	 The goal was to discover trends and pain points to help the business grow.

✅ Task
•	 My responsibility was to analyse the sales data using SQL.
•	 I needed to uncover actionable insights to help make smarter, data-backed business decisions.
•	The final output was to be a clear and insightful report showing trends, top items, and improvement areas.
________________________________________
✅ Action
•	 Collected and studied the data from four tables: orders, order_details, pizzas, and pizza_types.
•	 Used Joins, Group By, CTEs, Subqueries, and Window Functions like ROW_NUMBER, RANK, and DENSE_RANK for deep analysis.
•	 Calculated:
o	 Category-wise total sales
o	 Top-selling pizzas by quantity and revenue
o	Peak sales hours
o	 Least-performing items
•	Performed time-based comparisons to identify churn trends and sales growth patterns.
•	Compiled all findings into a final report with insights, visuals, and recommendations.

✅ Final Recommendations for Business Growth (Based on Analysis)
1.	Revamp the Menu:
o	Replace or rework underperforming pizzas with low sales and low customer interest.
o	Promote fast-growing lesser-known pizzas (e.g., Thai or Southwest varieties), they show untapped potential.
2.	Time-Based Promotions:
o	Launch targeted offers during evening hours and weekends, when sales are naturally high, to boost revenue even further.
o	Consider weekday lunch deals to attract traffic during low-activity periods.
3.	 Bundle High & Low Sellers:
o	Combine top-sellers (like Deluxe or Classic) with lower-selling items in combo offers to increase overall product movement.
4.	 Category-Based Inventory Planning:
o	Use sales data to forecast demand by category (e.g., Veg vs Chicken vs Beef) reduce wastage, improve stocking efficiency.
5.	 Loyalty & Retention Program:
o	Use churn rate insights to identify repeat vs lost customers.
o	Introduce loyalty rewards or personalized discounts to retain high-value buyers.
6.	 Feedback Loop for Low-Sellers:
o	Collect customer feedback on pizzas that aren’t performing well,find out whether it’s taste, ingredients, or pricing.
7.	 Geo & Event-Based Campaigns:
o	Analyse location-wise performance and run hyperlocal offers.
o	Align campaigns with local events or seasons like discounts during sports finals or festive weekends.
